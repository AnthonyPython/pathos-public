I want to thank the following parties for their part with developing this project:
 - Valve Software for the code referenced(aka clean room design) from the Half-Life SDK while developing this project.
 - Id Software for the code referenced(aka clean room design) from the Quake 1 engine while developing this project.
 - dreamstalker for the code referenced(aka clean room design) from ReHLDS while developing this project.
 - Magic Nipples for helping me with the motorbike's surface alignment code.
 - Yriy "BUzer" Sitnikov for the mod Paranoia, and the help he gave me while developing 
   the renderer code under the original mod version.
 - Ryokeen for his help with graphics programming back in the early days.
 - Various other sources whose snippets I used to solve some problems.
 - K.V. "Enko" Stepchenko for supplying the beam renderer code I referenced to write my own version of it
 
Note:
If you don't find your name in the credits list, and you find code that seems
like it belongs to you, please contact me, and I will add your name to the
credits list if it checks out that I used your code.

Parts of the code were written ages ago, some are over ten years old, and
because of that a lot has been lost to time, and to my lackluster bookkeeping.
